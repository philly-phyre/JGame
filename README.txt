# JGame
Java text-based RPG


This is a simple Text-Based RPG set in a mythical land. The source code is written in the Java language.

It is also a project for me (Phil) to learn Java more in-depth as I continue to
build the game. I'm using a learn-as-you-go technique with any ideas that I think of
for this game, and implementing them at whatever means possible.

Feel free to email or message me with any comments or suggestions: philecarpenter@gmail.com
